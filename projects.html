                    <h3>Project Three</h3>
                    <p class="subtext">During my diploma internship, I had the opportunity to develop a robust ID card generator application in Python, under the guidance of my teachers. This application streamlined the process of creating professional ID cards with scannable QR codes. Leveraging the power of Python's libraries and frameworks, I designed an intuitive and user-friendly interface that allowed users to input their information and customize the design of the ID card. The application then generated a high-quality ID card with a unique QR code that could be scanned for quick identification and verification.</p>
